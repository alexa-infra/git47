git47
=====

git47 is a web frontend for git repositories written in pure Go.

- this is not a GitHub/GitLab replacement
- there are no plans to add collaboration features (pull requests, issues, comments etc)
- inspired by [git.sr.ht][1], [sorcia][2] and of course GitHub/GitLab interfaces
- based on awesome [go-git][3] library
- there is no client js now, not intentionally
- there are performance issues on big repositories (like linux kernel), not focusing on that now
- not suitable for any usage right now, still in development, very slow development
